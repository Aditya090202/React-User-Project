# **Basic React App using state and custom components**

Created a React App using mulitple components to create a login interface which takes input and renders an item using the data on the page.

# Features:
1. Allows user to enter input data into the text field and renders an item using that data on the screen
2. Uses modals on two special cases 
     - First, both the text fields are empty a dialog box is shown which says "Invalid input" and asks to enter valid data 
     - Second, if age is less than 0, a dialog box appears which says "Invalid input" and asks for a valid age

# Debugging 
   - Need to figure out to conditonally render the div that holds the list items when button clicked and no data is added.
